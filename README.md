# Deep Learning and Neural Networks Challenges
This repository contains the solutions to three challenges of the **Deep Learning and Neural Networks** exam at **Politecnico di Milano**. The challenges involve image classification, image segmentation, and visual question answering, each focusing on different aspects of deep learning and computer vision.

## Challenge 1: Image Classifier (Object Classification)
In this challenge, the goal was to build an image classifier to identify various objects from a given dataset. The dataset includes a wide range of objects, from planes to wine bottles. The task was to train a deep learning model capable of classifying images into predefined categories.

### Key Steps:
1. **Dataset Preparation**: The dataset was preprocessed by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the data to improve model generalization.
2. **Model Architecture**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: The model was trained using cross-entropy loss and evaluated using accuracy. Performance was assessed on a validation set.

### Tools and Libraries:
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
